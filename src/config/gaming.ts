/**
 * Andy's consoles, for the gaming card on the Devices tab.

 * PS5: the PlayStation Network integration, on the PSN account he plays on
 * (it's under Rodolfo's name, "rufongora"). Its media player is off / on
 * (online on the console) / playing (in a game); on + playing both count as
 * screen time. The today/week totals are HA history_stats sensors in
 * configuration.yaml on skylab; the 7-day chart is worked out from history.
 *
 * Switch: the Nintendo Switch parental controls integration ("rudy's
 * Switch 2"). It reports the whole console's screen time used today (it
 * resets at midnight), so daily totals are the day's highest reading.
